# poem-learning-git-npm

This project started as a small exercise to learn git and build npm task-runner. 
In the end it's a site I love to go back because it contains one of the most known poem of Wislawa Szymborska called "Nothing happens twice".
<br />I've learned how to build task runner using npm and how to work more efficient with git and github.
